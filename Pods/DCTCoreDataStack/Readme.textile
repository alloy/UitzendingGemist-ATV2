h1. DCTCoreDataStack

DCTCoreDataStack is intended for non-document based apps, and sets up the whole Core Data structure such that after initializing, the managedObjectContext property is ready for use.
 
DCTCoreDataStack provides the following features:
 
# An encapsulation of the complete Core Data stack of NSManagedObjectContext, NSPersistentStoreCoordinator, NSPersistentStore, and NSManagedObjectModel
# On supporting OS's, writing to disk is performed on a background thread, by using a parent context. Saving the main context automatically triggers saving the parent context asynchronously
# -[NSManagedObjectContext dct_saveWithCompletionHandler:] method can be used to be notified when saving to disk finishes, asynchronously if possible
# Allows you to resolve errors when loading the persistent store by setting the @didResolvePersistentStoreErrorHandler@ block and handling the error
# On iOS, the app entering the background, or terminating, automatically triggers a save if needed. You can be notified of such saves by setting the @automaticSaveCompletionHandler@ block
# On iOS, when saving on a background thread, the stack protects against termination/suspension by declaring the save as a background task
# Providing YES for DCTCoreDataStackExcludeFromBackupStoreOption in the storeOptions will exclude the persistent store from being backed up
