BackRow:
* How do I generate the header dump of ATV2 OS 5.0.1 myself? The BackRow framework doesn't exist anymore and dumping the AppleTV app doesn't give me everything.

FRAppliance.xctemplate:
* Add build setting to compile sources as Objective-C++ (for BackRowExtras.h)
* Add InfoPlist.strings file with app title
* Add AppIcon.png (this is apperantly different on other OS versions, I have 5.0.1)

App:
* Before making a request check that we have the required cookie instead of hoping for the best and making a possible extra request in the process.
* Reclaim singleton memory when appliance closes.
* Add remote logging with different levels. Maybe NSLogger over network? Does images too.
* Do we even need the TopShelfController on 5.0.1?
* Use Core Data?
* Check what NSURLCache is caching and/or optimize. E.g. Cache banners of favorites to disk.
* There’s a potential memleak in HTMLNode.m when the first attr is NULL, newVal never gets freed.

### Release

* Currently our crash reporter takes over all crash reporting (for all apps), I’m not sure if it’s a real problem, but it doesn’t sound nice,
  * Is there currently a uncaught exception handler set?
  * Can we get events of when our appliance is started and ended? (Maybe appliance init/dealloc?) and can we disable our crash reporter when the appliance is de-activated? I.e. save the uncaught exception handler that's already set and restore it.
  * Otherwise possibly submit the crash reports the AppleTV stores itself? Only lame thing is that it doesn't contain the exception reason, which is logged to the syslog.
