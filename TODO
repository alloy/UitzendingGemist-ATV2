BackRow:
* How do I generate the header dump of ATV2 OS 5.0.1 myself? The BackRow framework doesn't exist anymore and dumping the AppleTV app doesn't give me everything.
* Can we use ARC? (In my naive experiments, the only issue is that some of the class-dumped headers arenâ€™t ARC compatible.)

FRAppliance.xctemplate:
* Add build setting to compile sources as Objective-C++ (for BackRowExtras.h)
* Add InfoPlist.strings file with app title
* Add AppIcon.png (this is apperantly different on other OS versions, I have 5.0.1)

App:
* Do we even need the TopShelfController on 5.0.1?
